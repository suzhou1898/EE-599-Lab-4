1.I used the command "g++ -fsanitize=address -ggdb -o BrokenASan BrokenASan.cpp".
 
2.Then i used the command "./BrokenASan" 
 
3.I found that 'arr' caused the leakage and there was one illegal memory unit . 
 
4.I checked the code and found that one of the arguments of the function quicksort() should be n-1.
