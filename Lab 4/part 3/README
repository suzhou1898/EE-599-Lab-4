Summary of Program: According to the Lab4 document PDF, i wrote these two programs to calculate the nth fibonacci number using the recursive and dynamic programming method as required. Apart from this, i also record the time it takes to calculate the number and print it on the terminal. By comparing them, i found that the dynamic programming takes less time, which is better.
